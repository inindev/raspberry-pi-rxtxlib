|   An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but

|   is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and

|
|   The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
|   any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
|   section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
|   case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
|   Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
|   future as another exception but one is not currently available.

|
|   As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
|   permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
|   RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
|   regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
|   and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
|   provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
|   copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
|   combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
|   Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
|   module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.
|
|   Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
|   to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
|   their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
|   gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
|   exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
|   carries forward this exception.

There are numerous possibilities for projects that involve serial communication.
Java is an excellent language for putting GUI apps together.  Well have fun.  
Send back stories. 

Copies of the latest RXTX will be on http://www.rxtx.org/download
The primary source for information/support is http://www.rxtx.org.
The rxtx mail-list is at Majordomo@hex.linuxgrrls.org.
Send email with "subscribe rxtx" in the subject without the quotes to join. 

This is a native lib for jdk 1.1.* and newer.  If you find changes required
for different platforms or OS's please pass them back this way so we may share
it with others.  Credit will be given unless one specifically requests no 
credit.

We chopped rxtx out of my program and tried to put a small example together.  
There is plenty of room for configurability, safe guarding and error reporting.
If you have some time please contribute some improvements.

We are interested in sharing this code in hopes that a more versatile lib may
be developed and released with minimal restrictions.  Please send any patches 
back my way if you like.

If you are interested in using rxtx for things like RS485, I2C or raw IO Please
get the latest CVS version.  Some work has been done for each of them.  The
latest development version is a stand alone implementation of CommAPI.

For bug reports please follow the directions in INSTALL
