|   RXTX License v 2.1 - LGPL v 2.1 + Linking Over Controlled Interface.
|   RXTX is a native interface to serial ports in java.
|   Copyright 2002-2004 Michal Hobot MichalHobot@netscape.net
|   actually wrote it.  See individual source files for more information.

|   An executable that contains no derivative of any portion of RXTX, but
|   is designed to work with RXTX by being dynamically linked with it,
|   is considered a "work that uses the Library" subject to the terms and
|   conditions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
|
|   The following has been added to the RXTX License to remove
|   any confusion about linking to RXTX.   We want to allow in part what
|   section 5, paragraph 2 of the LGPL does not permit in the special
|   case of linking over a controlled interface.  The intent is to add a
|   Java Specification Request or standards body defined interface in the 
|   future as another exception but one is not currently available.

|
|   As a special exception, the copyright holders of RXTX give you
|   permission to link RXTX with independent modules that communicate with
|   RXTX solely through the Sun Microsytems CommAPI interface version 2,
|   regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy
|   and distribute the resulting combined work under terms of your choice,
|   provided that every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a complete
|   copy of the source code of RXTX (the version of RXTX used to produce the
|   combined work), being distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
|   Public License plus this exception.  An independent module is a
|   module which is not derived from or based on RXTX.
|
|   Note that people who make modified versions of RXTX are not obligated
|   to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
|   their choice whether to do so.  The GNU Lesser General Public License
|   gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
|   exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
|   carries forward this exception.
|
|   You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
|   License along with this library; if not, write to the Free
